This Software License Agreement (this "Agreement") is between you (either an individual or an entity, referred to hereinafter as "you" or "your") and vBulletin Solutions, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Internet Brands, Inc., and its affiliates and resellers ("vBulletin Solutions", "we", "our" or "us") for the vBulletin software that accompanies this Agreement, as may be updated or replaced by feature enhancements, software updates or maintenance releases including the vBulletin 5.x Connect Software, any previously released vBulletin Software under a different version, vBulletin Mobile Suite, the vBulletin Facebook application, the Forum Runner application, related explanatory written materials and files ("Documentation"), and any other add-ons or related products (together, the "Software") and any services, including but not limited to Mobile Annual Support, Forum Support, Phone and Ticket Support, and Professional Install/Upgrade, that may be provided by vBulletin Solutions under this Agreement (together, "Services").
</p><p>
By copying, installing, downloading, or using all or any portion of the Software, you accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. vBulletin Solutions owns all intellectual property in the Software. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use the Software. This Agreement is enforceable against you and any legal entity that obtained the Software and on whose behalf it is used. 
</p>
<h2>1.	Software License.</h2>
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTICE: If you are domiciled in the European Union ("E.U."), please refer to Section 19 for specific provisions related to the Software and the License. 
</p><p>
Provided you comply with the term and conditions of this Agreement and have paid the applicable license fees, vBulletin Solutions grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, , worldwide, limited license to install, download and use a single instance of the Software on a single website domain in a manner consistent with its designs and Documentation as further set forth below and not for purposes of resale or re-compilation, re-distribution, re-syndication, time sharing or use for the benefit for any third-party (the "License"). Upon vBulletin Solutions’ receipt of the applicable license fees, a unique license number will be issued to you. 
</p><p>
1.1 Limited Use. You may not transfer, rent, sublicense, assign, lease, loan, resell for profit, redistribute, encumber, publish or otherwise share the Software (or related materials based upon the Software or any part thereof) without the prior written consent of vBulletin Solutions. You must not use the Software other than as permitted by the License or in a manner inconsistent with its design and Documentation. If you are domiciled in the E.U., please refer to Section 19.
</p><p>
1.2 Notices. The Software must contain vBulletin Solutions’ copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on or in the Software, unless a Branding Free License is purchased.
</p><p>
1.3 Illegal Activity. You may not use the Software to engage in or allow others to engage in any illegal activity where the Software is accessed and/or used. You may not use the Software to engage in any activity that will violate the rights of third parties, including, without limitation, through the use, public display, public performance, reproduction, distribution, or modification of communications or materials that infringe copyrights, trademarks, publicity rights, privacy rights, other proprietary rights, or rights against defamation of third parties.
</p><p>
1.4 Domain Use. The Software may only be used on a single website domain. Any modification of the Software intended to circumvent the foregoing is prohibited and will result in revocation of the License. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the License may be transferred to another domain with vBulletin Solutions’ prior written consent and a transfer fee subject to the vBulletin Solutions then current fees. 
</p><p>
1.5 Need for Content licenses. The License provides no rights with respect to any content that may be reproduced, encoded, distributed, transmitted, performed, or otherwise used in connection with the Software. You are responsible for ensuring that any content is properly used in accordance with applicable laws and the rights of any third party with respect to such content. 
</p><p>
1.6 Backup Copy. You may make one (1) copy of the Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. You may only use the backup copy if the original copy of the Software is no longer usable and the only way to use the Software is to reinstall the Software by use of the backup copy. Any permitted copy of the Software that you make must contain the same copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on or in the Software, unless a Branding Free License is purchased.

If you are domiciled in the E.U., please refer to Section 19.
</p><p>
1.9 Pre-release Software Additional Terms. If the Software is pre-commercial release or beta software ("Pre-release Software"), then this section applies. The Pre-release Software is a pre-release version, does not represent a final product from vBulletin Solutions, and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss and may only be used for testing purposes. vBulletin Solutions may never commercially release the Pre-release Software. vBulletin Solutions may alter features, licensing terms, or other characteristics of any version of the Pre-release Software that it releases. If you received the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, ("Test Agreement") for Pre-release Software, your use of the Software is also governed by the Test Agreement. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and the Test Agreement, the Test Agreement controls. You may not disclose, publish or disseminate any information regarding the Pre-release Software to anyone, including but not limited to any new features or faults to any Internet forums. YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 7 AND 8 FOR WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.
</p><p>
1.10 Updates. "Update(s)" will mean the release of a version of the Software containing improvements, corrections, modifications, alterations, revisions, extensions, language versions, and/or enhancements to the Software and/or Documentation made during the term of this Agreement. The change to an Update will be recognized by an increase in value of number to the right of a decimal point (e.g., version 5.0 to be replaced by version 5.1). In order to install an Update, you must possess a valid license to the previous version of the Software.  Once an Update is installed, this Agreement pertains to the Updated version of the Software. We recommend you install all Updates that specifically contain bug fixes. If you are domiciled in the E.U., and have not purchased the Software from vBulletin Solutions or its authorized resellers, an Update may be licensed to you with different or additional terms and an Upgrade fee subject to the vBulletin Solutions’ then-current fees.
</p><p>
1.11 Upgrade. "Upgrade" will mean the release of a version of the Software containing major changes to the structure of the Software where important new features may be added for an upgrade fee. The change to an Upgrade will be recognized by an increase in value of the number to the left of the decimal point (e.g., version 5.x to be replaced by version 6.x). Any Upgrade discounts offered to licensees by vBulletin Solutions are non-transferable. vBulletin Solutions may, at its sole discretion, cease providing support for any prior version of the Software after an Upgrade is made available. 
</p>

19.1 No Prejudice, E.U. Provisions.
</p><p>
19.1.1 No Transfer. YOU WILL NOT RENT, LEASE, SELL, SUBLICENSE, ASSIGN, OR TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS IN THE SOFTWARE, OR AUTHORIZE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO BE COPIED ONTO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY’S COMPUTER EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREIN. You may, however, permanently transfer all your rights to use the Software (excluding Services, access to product Updates, discounts, and the use of customer support and forums) to another individual or legal entity provided that: (a) you also transfer (i) this Agreement; (ii) the license number(s), the Software affixed to media provided by vBulletin Solutions or its authorized reseller, and all other software or hardware bundled, packaged, or pre-installed with the Software, including all copies, Updates, and prior versions; (b) you retain no Updates or copies, including backups and copies stored on a Computer or in the cloud; and (c) the receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other terms and conditions under which you purchased the License to the Software. For the purpose of clarity, other vBulletin products and services, including support contracts, access to product updates, discounts, and the use of support forums are non-transferable. Prior to a transfer, vBulletin Solutions might require that you and the receiving party confirm in writing your compliance with this Agreement, provide vBulletin Solutions with information about yourselves, and register as end-users of the Software. Allow 4-6 weeks to effect the transfer. Prior to any transfer, you must contact vBulletin Solutions Customer Support Department at sales@vbulletin.com. Upon transfer of the Software, your License is automatically terminated. 
</p><p>
19.1.2 This Agreement will not prejudice the statutory rights of any party, including those dealing as consumers. 
</p><p>
19.1.3 This Agreement, and in particular, this Section 19.1.3, is intended to describe your rights (including your statutory rights) in the event there should be problems with your use of the Software. If your statutory rights are greater than this description, your statutory rights will apply. If you obtained the Software in the E.U., you usually reside in the E.U., and you are a consumer (that is you use the Software for personal, non-business related purposes), then Section 7 does not apply to your purchase and use of the Software. Instead, vBulletin Solutions warrants for a period of two (2) years from purchase that the Software provides the functionalities when used on the recommended hardware configuration. Non-substantial variation from the agreed upon functionalities will not establish any warranty rights. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY IF THE SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY YOU. To make a warranty claim, you must notify the vBulletin Solutions Customer Support Department at sales@vbulletin.com during this two (2) year period, providing details or proof of purchase of the Software. vBulletin Solutions will verify with you whether there is a defect in the Software or advise you that the error arises because you have not installed the Software correctly (in which case, vBulletin Solutions will assist you). If there is a defect in the Software, you may request from vBulletin Solutions either a refund or replacement copy of the Software. Requests must be accompanied by proof of purchase. In the event your warranty details are not substantiated, vBulletin Solutions will meet your request for replacement Software, unless it is not reasonable for vBulletin Solutions to do so, in which case vBulletin Solutions will provide you with a refund. For warranty assistance, please contact the vBulletin Solutions Customer Support Department.
</p><p>
The provisions of Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) will continue to apply to any damages claims you make in respect of your use of the Software. vBulletin Solutions may be liable if so determined by a court of competent jurisdiction for direct losses that are reasonably foreseeable in the event of a material breach by vBulletin Solutions of this Agreement. You are advised to take all reasonable measures to avoid, reduce or otherwise mitigate damages, in particular by making one (1) back-up copy of the Software and your computer data, and we strongly recommend purchasing Updates, as they often include important security patches.
